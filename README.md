# MAX Index (Multimodal Accessibility Index)

The MAX Index is a tool for measuring the level of multimodal accessibility in a given area. It can be run as a tool in ArcGIS or ArcGIS Pro and analyzes various data sources to determine a total score, or MAX score, for an area. The data sources used include:

- Bike Lane Data
- Bus Headway Data
- Volume to Capacity Ratio Data
- Level of Service Data
- Transportation Improvement Program Data
- Trail Data
- Bike Sharrow Data
- Bus Stop Data
- Micromobility Data
- Walkability Data
- Bus Rapid Transit data

The MAX score is intended to provide urban planners and GIS professionals with a holistic view of an area's level of multimodal accessibility. This can be used to identify areas that need improvement, set goals for transportation and land-use projects, and evaluate the impact of transportation projects on accessibility.

## Getting Started

To use the MAX Index, you will need to have ArcMap 10.x or ArcGIS Pro installed on your computer. The tool can be run on your own data or on sample data that is provided with the tool.

## Customization

The MAX Index tool is designed to be flexible and customizable. You can change the inputs, scoring mechanism, etc to suit your community. You can also fork the code on github, and make your own changes to the tool using Python.
